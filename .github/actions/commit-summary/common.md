# GameTracking commit summary

Find everything that changed in a Valve Source 2 game between two builds. Report it to dataminers as a comment on the commit. The diff is the job, and the comment is its report. A missed change or a wrong claim costs more than time.

GameTracking repos track a game's files under `game/` and the dumps made from them. These are:
- VPK listings (`*_dir.txt`)
- decompiled content
- binary string dumps (`*_strings.txt`)
- protobufs
- DumpSource2 (convars, commands, schemas, network, entities)
- depot manifests (`manifests/`)

Do not change the repo. The working tree is at `<sha>`. Read older builds with `git show <prev>:<path>`. You can make temp files with `mktemp`.

## Rules for findings

- **Report changes to the game, not to the files.** These are noise:
  - re-dumps, decompiler or serialiser changes, recompiles
  - lists that catch up, strings that move between dumps, translation catch-ups
  - CRC-only changes to models, textures, particles and sounds, unless strings, convars or schemas show a matching code change
- **"New"** means the check finds nothing at `<prev>`. Otherwise write "newly listed in X".
  - A path is new only if it is absent at `<prev>`. A folder is new only if nothing under it existed. Otherwise write "new files in X".
  - A CRC change is not new content.
  - A schema field can exist at `<prev>` with a default, and data can start to set it. That field is not new. Report `default → value`.
  - Before you call a class, message or system new, look for the same thing at `<prev>` under another name or in another file. Examples are a renamed class, or a message that moved to another proto. If it is there, report the rename or move.
- **"Removed"** means absent from the whole tree at `<sha>`.
- Check both sides of a rename. Check each name on its own, not by its relation to a feature.
- **The check.** For "new", `git grep -a -w -F -c -e '<name>' <prev> | head -3` prints nothing. Any output means the name existed, so say where. For "removed", the same command at `<sha>` prints nothing. Substring or case-insensitive greps do not count for either.
- **Diff by meaning.**
  - Compare lists as sets, in both directions. Names that are gone from the whole tree are findings too.
  - In sorted files, an edited string shows as a removal plus a near-identical addition. Report it as a rename, old next to new.
  - Only names that clearly match are renames. A removed set and a different added set are a removal and an addition.
  - Report repeated identical edits as one change.
  - Normalise formats before you decide that something changed.
- **A schema default is not the game's value.** Report the value that the data sets.
- **Do not read engine terms by their everyday meaning.** Quote them, old next to new. Describe a mechanic from the English description and the data together, never from a property or class name alone. Before you call an entry an error or inconsistency, check how existing entries do it.
- **Display names** come from the English localization (`git ls-tree -r --name-only <sha> | grep -i english`), never from memory.
- **Evidence strength**, strongest first:
  1. game data and localization
  2. schemas, protobufs and convars
  3. asset lists
  4. binary strings

  When strings are the only evidence, write "strings suggest".
- **Never call anything a leak, unreleased or upcoming.** State the evidence instead, for example "only in tool binaries" or "no entity dump in this game implements it".

## Writing

The reader is a dataminer who skims a feed.
- Write one bullet per change, in plain English that reads correctly the first time.
- Name things. Do not describe files: no sizes, CRCs, hashes, versions, build dates or counts. Game values are fine.
- Keep each bullet short. Do not join facts with semicolons. When a change has several groups of facts (stats, upgrades, values), give each group an indented sub-bullet.
- Give each change what a dataminer needs: the name, old → new values, convar defaults and flags, key strings, and the mechanics that the data shows.
- Leave implementation detail out of a bullet, unless it is the evidence. Examples are internal UI and style names, layout values, audio settings, full paths, enum numbers, and descriptions that repeat the bullet. This rule makes bullets shorter. It never removes a bullet.
- `→` marks a changed value. Give new content as plain values or ranges. Write timestamps in game data as dates.
- Name a changed file whose content is not tracked (a map, a script, a localization file), in plain words: "map `dl_midtown` changed". Rebuilt binaries, `.signatures` and tool asset caches are recompiles. Never name them.
- Write about the game, not about the repo or the analysis. Do not write "content not tracked", "no readable copy in the repo" or "a code change can't be ruled out". Say what did not change only when that is the point, in a few words ("text only, item data unchanged").
- Give lists of new or removed items in full, never as examples. If a set is too long to list, name its folder and its purpose. Never count it.
- Mark each inference once, with one word ("inferred"). Do not stack hedges ("presumably …, inferred").
- Write impersonally. Never write "I".

## Output

Write `NO_COMMENT` if nothing is worth telling a dataminer. This includes a build whose only changes are rebuilt binaries, CRC-only asset changes, tracker noise, translation catch-ups or trivial string edits.

Otherwise write only the comment body:

```
<one short sentence, under ~120 chars>

### Engine update
- <one shared engine system per bullet; omit the section if none>

### <Feature group>
- …

### Other changes
- <one minor change per bullet; omit the section if none>
```

- The first line names the most notable changes or the commit type. Commit types are a rollback, a re-release of a rolled-back build, or a dump re-run. For these, give the SHAs of the related commits.
- The first line has no build numbers or versions, and no labels like "Small update:" or "Minor content update:".
- Put shared engine changes that another game already has in one short `### Engine update` section. This section comes first, before the sections about this game. Write one bullet per system with "also in <game> <build>", and no detail. Write the changes that only this game has in full, in their own bullets.
- Put identifiers from other games or unannounced projects in their own section.
- The number of real changes sets the length, not the detail per change.
- With only a few changes, use no headings: put the bullets under the first line. Leave out a bullet that only repeats the first line.
